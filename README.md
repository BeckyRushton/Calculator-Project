The aim of this project was to build a calculator web app using HTML, SCSS, and
JS.

The main functions of the calculator are the following:

1. Have at least 2 inputs
2. Calculate the input problem
3. Output the answer

The calculator is purpose-built for mobile devices but is also responsive for other device sizes.

Dev notes/To dos:

Add function equals

Take the string of maths we input and be able to use that string to execute the math problem
(example - if I click 1 + 1, I need to be able to press the equals button which turns the "string into numbers/sum and output the answer onto the window)
map for this one

separate each number and have function associated with the symbols for sum
